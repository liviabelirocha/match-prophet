# Match Prophet

## Data Science - CK0223

Match Prophet is a local match prediction algorithm that decides which team has the highest chance of winning. The product is meant to be our Data Science project for a Computer Science class and only that. Drawing from our love for the game, we'll use Machine Learning Algorithms and the Data from Riot's API as well as our understanding of the game to create the final algorithm for the project.
